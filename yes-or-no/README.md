## First Challenge : Simple Yes Or No

### Project Scaffolding
Azure Functions + React

Azure Functions
* 1 API (return yes/no)
* CORS Setting ('*')

#### Create new project in Azure function extension in VSCode is working weird.
1. I couldn't choose region `Korea Central` and `Korea South`
2. As there are no permission in VSCode, all files are **READ-ONLY**. Can't editable.
3. I had have to create project in Azure portal to make/edit function.
4. If create project in VSCode, core function file including `index.js` is not create.
4-1. Also in portal, couldn't access to function edit page.
