## Main Goal

There is no better way to learn a new technology than with gamification. And we're here to help you learn Serverless once and for all with 25 daily challenges: 25 days of Serverless! Come join!

## Rules

1. Solve each [coding challenge](https://aka.ms/25daysofserverless) in the first 25 days of December.

2. Tweet your progress during the challenge period using the hashtag [#25DaysOfServerless](https://twitter.com/search?q=%2325DaysOfServerless).

3. Submit the code of your solution as a PR to this repository before the sample solution gets published (usually 24h after the challenge is published).

4. You may get picked for a mention during our weekly wrap-up video. If you submit a PR you agree that we mention your name and/or nicknames (GitHub, Twitter) publicly in the context of 25 Days of Serverless.
